# In this folder, we give an example of how to simulate the post-translational process of a peptide protein in a CG model with charges
# Run in.post_intial first to equilibrate the poltpeptide chain whose C-terminus is fixed at the PTC
# Then run in.post_NC to release the polypeptide and track its movement until all amino acid resiudes exit the tunnel
